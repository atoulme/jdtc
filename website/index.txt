h2. How to submit patches

Read the "8 steps for fixing other people's code":http://drnicwilliams.com/2007/06/01/8-steps-for-fixing-other-peoples-code/ and for section "8b: Submit patch to Google Groups":http://drnicwilliams.com/2007/06/01/8-steps-for-fixing-other-peoples-code/#8b-google-groups, use the Google Group above.

You can fetch the source from either:

<% if rubyforge_project_id %>

* rubyforge: "http://rubyforge.org/scm/?group_id=<%= rubyforge_project_id %>":http://rubyforge.org/scm/?group_id=<%= rubyforge_project_id %>

<pre>git clone git://rubyforge.org/jdtc.git</pre>

<% else %>

* rubyforge: MISSING IN ACTION

TODO - You can not created a RubyForge project, OR have not run <code>rubyforge config</code>
yet to refresh your local rubyforge data with this projects' id information.

When you do this, this message will magically disappear!

Or you can hack website/index.txt and make it all go away!!

<% end %>

* github: "http://github.com/atoulme/jdtc/tree/master":http://github.com/atoulme/jdtc/tree/master

<pre>git clone git://github.com/GITHUB_USERNAME/jdtc.git</pre>
